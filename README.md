Into the thick of it Into the thick of it Into the thick of it Ugh Were tramping through the bush On and on we push Into the thick of it But we cant see where were going Weve made a stellar start To find the jungles heart But all well find is nothing If we cant see where were going Into the thick of it Into the thick of it Into the thick of it But we cant see where were going Into the thick of it Into the thick of it Into the thick of it But we cant see where were going Ugh The jungles kind of tricky The path is never straight And sometimes theres no path at all Which makes it hard to navigate Although the jungles thick Were moving through it quick But that wont do us any good If were going around in circles Into the thick of it Into the thick of it Into the thick of it Were going round in circles Ugh These trees look so familiar Weve been here once before Youre right except it wasnt once It was three times or four Stuck in the thick of it Stuck in the thick of it Stuck in the thick of it Weve gone around in circles
